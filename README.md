# DVDbounce

## An easy example project of a "DVD screensaver"

> 1. This project required about 50 "inventive" lines of "pretty" code
> 2. It contains at most two game engine concepts
>>    1. a viewport
> >   2. an actor / object
> 3. I personally used JS objects, but they are not necessary, the "engine" doesn't require them, they are just for convenience and some encapsulation 
> 4. No, any text editor will do, it took me a few minutes to get used to the IDE
> 5. Yes, the game's source code is very easy to share, it is a one-file solution
> 6. One line of in-tag css and two lines of JS code for compatibility
> 7. All platforms can play as long as they have a browser in which your clicks send a `"mousedown"` event
> 8. This doesn't require a binary
> 9. It requires you to write your own functions | methods as it is only responsible for drawing
